Last year I asked the students if there was anything they wish they knew at the start of the project.

## Can I use custom transistors sizes?

Yes. The transistors/cells as well as the combinations of them (NAND, OR, diverse cells, etc.) are made for you such that you will not have to determine the transistor sizes. They have also been made to help you get started.

> Hint: One way to "change" the sizes is to put several of the predefined transistors/cells in series or parallel.
